## Loacl setup

* Clone this repository
* Run `npm install` within the project root
* To run the E2E tests run `npm run test`, once Cypress opens click on "Run 4 integration specs"
* To run API tests run `npm run test-api`
* To run Load tests run `npm run test-load`

If for any reason you would like to generate a new load test report, then run `npm run test-load-report` after the `npm run test-load` command completes and you will see a report.html file gets created
